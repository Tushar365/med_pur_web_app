## GST Implementation

The MedSync database is designed to support GST (Goods and Services Tax) requirements for Indian pharmacies:

1. Each product has a `gstRate` field that stores the applicable GST percentage
2. Each product has an `hsnCode` field for GST classification
3. The `price` field in the Products table stores the base price without GST
4. The `total` field in Order Items includes the GST amount
5. The `total` field in Orders is the sum of all order items with GST included

## Security Considerations

1. User passwords are stored as hashed values, not plaintext
2. Sensitive customer information should be handled according to data protection regulations
3. Role-based access control is implemented through the `users.role` field

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance, consider adding indexes to:

1. Foreign key columns (franchiseId, productId, orderId, etc.)
2. Frequently queried columns (status, orderDate, etc.)
3. Unique columns (username, email)

## Data Migration Notes

When migrating data to this schema:

1. Create franchises first
2. Then create users, products, and customers
3. Finally create orders, order items, and inventory records

## Next Steps

After understanding the database schema, you may want to:

1. Review the [Database Migrations Guide](./migrations.md) for managing schema changes
2. Explore the [API Endpoints Documentation](../api/endpoints.md) to understand how the application interacts with the database
